# JavaScript Functions Guide

This guide explains the basics of JavaScript functions, including how to invoke and write them. Functions are blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks and can be reused by calling them.

## Invoking Functions

Functions in JavaScript are recognizable by their parentheses `()`. You can call a function in the following ways:

```javascript
// Function with no arguments
nameOfTheFunction();

// Function with multiple arguments
functionThatTakesInput("the input", 5, true);
